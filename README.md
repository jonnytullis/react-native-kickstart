# React Native Kickstart
Save hours of configuration by using this kickstart
template for a React Native project using Expo.

### Run
* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* A browser tab will open in the browser with options to run on either an iOS/Android
  emulator or the browser itself.

### Configuration
* Customizable themes for light/dark modes on iPhone and Android.
* Routing and navigation. This project uses bottom-tabs for routing
  to pages but it's easy to customize (see https://reactnavigation.org/docs
  for more information).
* ESLint config file for most common React rules.
